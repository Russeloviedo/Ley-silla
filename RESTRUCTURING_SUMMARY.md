# Complete Restructuring Summary - Analysis Selection System

## Overview
The application has been completely restructured from a 3-selection system to a new 5-selection system for analyzing bipedestation risks in the workplace.

## New 5-Selection Structure

### 1. Business Unit (Unidad de Negocio)
- **Fixed Options**: Irrigation, DD, FX, HCM, Support
- **Reduced from**: Previous 17+ options to exactly 5
- **Purpose**: Primary business division selection

### 2. Plant (Planta)
- **Fixed Options**: Plant 1, Plant 2, Plant 3, Plant 4
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Based on selected Business Unit
- **Example**: If Business Unit is only available in Plant 1 and Plant 2, Plant 3 and Plant 4 are not selectable

### 3. Shift (Turno)
- **Dynamic Options**: Based on Business Unit + Plant combination
- **Examples**: Morning, Afternoon, Night
- **Purpose**: Work schedule selection

### 4. Area (Área)
- **Dynamic Options**: Based on Business Unit + Plant + Shift combination
- **Examples**: Production, Quality, Maintenance, Assembly, Molding, Warehouse
- **Purpose**: Specific department or operational area

### 5. Position (Puesto)
- **Dynamic Options**: Based on all previous selections
- **Examples**: Operator, Supervisor, Technician, Inspector
- **Purpose**: Specific job role or position

## Flow After 5 Selections
Once all 5 selections are completed, the user is automatically directed to:
1. **Initial Questions** (2 questions)
2. **Flowchart Questionnaire**
3. **Weighting Questionnaire** (if applicable)
4. **Final Results**

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created
- `app/(tabs)/seleccion-business-unit.tsx` - Business Unit selection
- `app/(tabs)/seleccion-plant.tsx` - Plant selection with filtering
- `app/(tabs)/seleccion-shift.tsx` - Shift selection with filtering
- `app/(tabs)/seleccion-area.tsx` - Area selection with filtering
- `app/(tabs)/seleccion-position.tsx` - Position selection with filtering
- `utils/selectionDataService.ts` - Data management service

### Updated Files
- `types/index.ts` - Complete type restructuring
- `utils/firestoreService.ts` - Database support for new fields
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - New home screen with navigation

### Data Service Architecture
The `SelectionDataService` manages all dynamic filtering:
- Business Unit → Plant mappings
- Business Unit + Plant → Shift mappings
- Business Unit + Plant + Shift → Area mappings
- Business Unit + Plant + Shift + Area → Position mappings

## Data Structure Changes

### New Database Fields
```typescript
interface HistorialAnalisis {
  // New 5-selection fields
  businessUnit: BusinessUnit;
  plant: Plant;
  shift: Shift;
  area: Area;
  position: Position;
  
  // Legacy fields (maintained for backward compatibility)
  unidad?: string;
  puesto?: string;
  subpuesto?: string;
  
  // Existing fields remain unchanged
  flujo: string;
  puntaje: number;
  nivel: NivelRiesgo;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Old data structure is maintained
- New fields are populated from old fields when possible
- Database exports include both old and new fields

## Navigation Flow
```
Home → Business Unit → Plant → Shift → Area → Position → Initial Questions → Flowchart → Weighting → Results
```

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. **Better Organization**
- Clear hierarchy from business unit to specific position
- Logical progression through organizational levels

### 2. **Dynamic Filtering**
- Users can only select valid combinations
- Prevents invalid selections and data inconsistencies

### 3. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new business units, plants, shifts, areas, or positions
- Centralized data management through SelectionDataService

### 4. **Data Quality**
- Structured data collection
- Better reporting and analysis capabilities

### 5. **User Experience**
- Clear progression through selections
- Visual feedback on previous selections
- Help modals with relevant definitions

## Data Loading Strategy

### Current Implementation
- Static data in `SelectionDataService`
- Example mappings for demonstration

### Future Implementation
- Database-driven data loading
- API integration for dynamic updates
- Admin interface for managing mappings

## Excel Export Updates

### Identification Table
- Includes all 5 new selection fields
- Maintains backward compatibility with old fields

### Risk Matrix Table
- Includes all 5 new selection fields
- Enhanced filtering and grouping capabilities

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Structure Implementation ✅
- New screens and navigation flow
- Type definitions and data service
- Database field additions

### Phase 2: Data Population
- Load actual business unit mappings
- Configure plant availability per business unit
- Set up shift schedules per plant
- Define areas per shift
- Establish positions per area

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- Test all selection combinations
- Validate filtering logic
- Ensure data consistency

### Phase 4: Deployment
- Deploy to production
- Monitor data collection
- Gather user feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Provide Business Unit Data**: Supply the actual mapping table for Business Units to Plants
2. **Configure Shift Mappings**: Define available shifts for each Business Unit + Plant combination
3. **Set Up Area Mappings**: Define available areas for each Business Unit + Plant + Shift combination
4. **Establish Position Mappings**: Define available positions for each complete combination
5. **Test Complete Flow**: Validate the entire selection process
6. **Update Excel Export**: Ensure new fields are properly included in exports

## Technical Notes

- All new screens maintain the existing UI/UX patterns
- Help modals provide relevant definitions for each selection level
- Navigation includes back buttons for easy correction
- Previous selections are displayed for context
- Automatic navigation to next step upon selection
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms in place

## Support and Maintenance

The new structure is designed to be:
- **Maintainable**: Centralized data management
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new options
- **Robust**: Comprehensive error handling
- **User-friendly**: Clear progression and feedback
- **Data-driven**: Dynamic filtering based on actual business rules
